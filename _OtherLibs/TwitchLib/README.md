# TwitchLib - Twitch Chat, API, and PubSub C# Library
[![Travis CI Build Test](https://api.travis-ci.org/swiftyspiffy/TwitchLib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/swiftyspiffy/TwitchLib/) [![NuGet Pre Release](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/TwitchLib.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TwitchLib)
### Overview
TwitchLib is a C# library that attempts to harness Twitch Chat, Twitch API, and Twitch PubSub into a single package. Using TwitchLib, you can connect to a Twitch channel's chat and send and receive chat messages as well as send and receive whisper messages! You can also fetch general Twitch API data like followers or user details as well as make authenticated channel modifications like stream title and game, as well as actions like commercials and and resetting of the stream key. Additionally, the TwitchLib project contains an example project that demonstrates the majority of functionality presented in the library.

### Documentation
I'm in the process of developing a website for very rough documentation and usage of this library. Parts of it is "done" and available if you are interested:
[http://swiftyspiffy.com/TwitchLib](http://swiftyspiffy.com/TwitchLib)


### Sample Implementation
```
TwitchClient client = new TwitchClient(new ConnectionCredentials("my_username", "my_oauth"), "my_channel");

client.OnConnected += clientConnected;
client.OnMessageReceived += clientMessageReceived;
client.OnWhisperCommandReceived += clientWhsiperReceived;

client.Connect();

client.SendMessage("A chat message.");
client.SendWhisper("whisper_receiver", "A whisper message.");

TwitchApi.BroadcasterOnline("my_favorite_streamer");
TwitchApi.GetTwitchFollowers("my_favorite_streamer");
TwitchApi.GetSubscriberCount("my_favorite_streamer", "my_favorite_streamer's_access_token");
TwitchApi.RunCommercial(TwitchApi.CommercialLength.Seconds180, "my_favorite_streamer", "my_favorite_streamer's_access_token");
```

- MessageThrottler - Property object that can be assigned to either Chat or Whisper clients, fires events and blocks sending of messages given a specific time period in order to prevent Twitch ToS violations. (OPTIONAL)

### Testing/Parsing Stability
I've recently taken to implementing this class into test applications and connecting them to large Twitch channels to see how the class handles fast moving chat and large TwitchAPI usage.  These are the events/channels I've had the library connected to.
- GamesDoneQuick (several days) - 80,000 - 200,000 concurrent, fixed a number of overflow and outofindex exceptions thrown when TwitchAPI returns service unavailable or TwitchIRC returns incomplete message data

### Examples and Implementations
- TwitchLibExample - This project is included in this repo as a master example project.
- PFCKrutonium's [TwitchieBot](https://github.com/PFCKrutonium/TwitchieBot) - This project implements the bot using VisualBasic.

### Libraries Utilized
- Newtonsoft.Json - JSON parsing class.  Used to parse Twitch API calls.
- SmartIRC4Net - Base IRC class.
- WebSocket4Net - Base Socket class.

### Support/Discussion
The Twitch Discord server has a #developer channel that has constant discussion about developing for the Twitch platform. You can likely get support and discuss ideas there. A link is below:
